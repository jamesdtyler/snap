.Sh NAME
.Nm snap
.Nd snapshot upgrade tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm snap
.Op Fl bBcdDehiIkKmMnrRsSuUvWx
.Op Fl b Op boot device
.Op Fl c Op config_file
.Op Fl D Op destination
.Op Fl m Op machine
.Op Fl M Op mirror
.Op Fl V Op version
.Op Fl s Op pubkey
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr ksh 1
script designed to upgrade an
.Ox
machine to the latest snapshot available.
Upgrading from release to release is not supported.
.Pp
.Nm
checks the `BUILDINFO` file located on the remote mirror, and will
warn you if the snapshot is not newer than the currently running
version.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
verifies signatures for the set files it downloads.
This can be prevented by specifying the
.Fl S
option, however, skipping verification is very much not recommended!
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar destination
Destination directory to place the `.tgz` files.
.It Fl S
Skip signature verification.
This is not recommended!
.It Fl c Ar config_file
Location of configuration file (default is
.Pa /etc/snap.conf
or
.Pa $HOME/.snaprc
).
.It Fl e
Extract sets into destination directory and exit.
The destination directory can be overwritten by the
.Fl D
option, or by setting the DST line in
.Pa config_file .
.It Fl d
Download sets to the destination directory, verify (
.Fl S
prevents signature verification) and
exit.
By default the destination directory is set to
.Pa /tmp/upgrade
.It Fl m Ar machine
Use
.Nm machine
instead of what the `machine` command returns.
.It Fl V Ar setversion
Use to specify a specific version of sets.
This option will need to be used when there is a version jump, say from 6.0 to 6.1.
.It Fl r
Run sysmerge after extracting {x}sets.
This option may cause issues if the newer snapshot introduces ABI changes.
Not recommended.
.It Fl x
Do not extract x11 sets.
.It Fl M Ar mirror
Specify which mirror to use.
.It Fl I Ar sigfile
Verify integrity of the
.Nm
tool.
If
.Nm sigfile
is omitted,
.Nm
will pull a copy of SHA256.sig from the GitHub page.
.It Fl s Ar pubkey
Signify pub key to do verification with.
.It Fl i
Run in interactive mode (has colors).
.It Fl n
Force snap to install
.Nm bsd.mp
as
.Pa /bsd
.It Fl k
Only install the kernels and exit.
.It Fl B
Prevent
.Nm
from making a backup of the kernel files.
.It Fl u
Check for update to the
.Nm
script.
.It Fl U
Download and install the latest version of
.Nm
(will overwrite currently installed version).
Signature verification is also done.
.It Fl b Ar device
Tells
.Nm
which
.Nm device
to install bootstrap on.
.It Fl R
Reboot after running
.Nm
.It Fl h
Help.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "$HOME/.last_snap"
.It Pa $HOME/.last_snap
Contains timestamp of the previous snapshot.
.It Pa /etc/snap.conf

See
.Sx SNAPRC
for more information on these options.
.It Pa $HOME/.snaprc

file:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm INTERACTIVE bool
If true,
.Nm
will operate as if
.Fl i
was specified.
Defaults to false.
.It Cm DST directory
Tells
.Nm
where to download the snapshot sets and signature files.
Defaults to
.Pa /tmp/upgrade
.It Cm EXTRACT_ONLY bool
Tells
.Nm
to exit after extracting the sets.
Defaults to false.
.It Cm FTP_OPTS string
Lets you overwrite the options passed to
.Xr ftp 1 .
This can be handy if your mirror supports file continuation!
Defaults to: " -V ".
.Pp
See
.Xr ftp 1
for options.
.It Cm MERGE bool
Tells
.Nm
to merge files in
.Pa /etc
using the
.Xr sysmerge 8
utility.
Defaults to false.
.It Cm NO_X11 bool
Tells
.Nm
to forgo download and extraction of xsets.
Defaults to false.
.It Cm REBOOT bool
Setting this to `true` will cause
.Nm
to reboot the system after successful extraction of sets.
Defaults to false.
.It Cm AFTER script
Specifies a script to be copied to
.Pa /etc/rc.firsttime .
The script will then be executed upon successful reboot.
Default is not set.
.It Cm MIRROR string
Defaults to `cdn.openbsd.org`.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss EXAMPLE USAGE
To upgrade to the latest snapshot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ doas snap
.Ed
.Pp
To upgrade to the latest snapshot using an explicit mirror region:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ doas snap -M cdn.openbsd.org
.Ed
.Pp
To upgrade to a snapshot without updating xsets:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ doas snap -x
.Ed
.Ss EXAMPLE SNAPRC
A typical
.Pa ~/.snaprc
would look something like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INTERACTIVE:true
MERGE:true
AFTER:/etc/after_snap
MIRROR:cdn.openbsd.org
FTP_OPTS:-C -V
.Ed
.Ss EXAMPLE AFTER SCRIPT
Here is an `AFTER` script that makes sure we have the latest devices
in
.Pa /dev ,
upgrades all the firmware currently installed and upgrades currently
installed packages:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
(
    cd /dev && sh MAKEDEV all
    /usr/sbin/fw_update -v
    /usr/sbin/pkg_add -uVm # -m is needed to see progress in this context
)
.Ed
.Sh SIGNATURE VERIFICATION
.Nm
can be verified using the
.Nm signify
utility.
.Ss Public key
.Bd -literal
untrusted comment: github.com/qbit/snap public key
RWQVGN6sUjQQA5uYpANGLLKQMAERZ43otLePFSVqNFGGtf/qBez7G1WU
.Ed
.Ss SIGNATURE URL
.Bd -literal
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbit/snap/master/SHA256.sig
.Ed
.Pp
After installing the above public key in
.Pa /etc/signify/snap.pub
and downloading the
.Pa SHA256.sig
file, you can verify
.Nm
by running one the following:
.Pp
Have snap download the
.Pa SHA256.sig
file and run verification:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ snap -I
.Ed
.Pp
Have snap verify a pre-downloaded
.Pa SHA256.sig
file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ snap -I SHA256.sig
.Ed
.Pp
Manual verification with the
.Nm signify
utility:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ signify -C -p /etc/signify/snap.pub -x SHA256.sig snap
